A call to analogWrite() is on a scale of 0 - 255, such that analogWrite(255) requests a 100% duty cycle (always on), and analogWrite(127) is a 50% duty cycle (on half the time) for example. 


 /**
   * Write an analog value (PWM-wave) to a digital pin.
   *
   * @param pin the pin to write to (must be 9, 10, or 11, as those are they
   * only ones which support hardware pwm)
   * @param value the value: 0 being the lowest (always off), and 255 the highest
   * (always on)
